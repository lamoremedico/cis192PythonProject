# next, we initialize VADER so we can use it within our Python script

# the variable 'message_text' now contains the text we will analyze.
# input texts needs ''' quotes before and after

I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.'''

# Calling the polarity_scores method on sid and passing in the message_text outputs a dictionary with negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores for the input text
scores = sid.polarity_scores(message_text)

# Here we loop through the keys contained in scores (pos, neu, neg, and compound scores) and print the key-value pairs on the screen
# for key in sorted(scores):
   # print('{0}: {1}, '.format(key, scores[key]), end='')

# scores prints: compound: -0.3804, neg: 0.093, neu: 0.836, pos: 0.071,

#  Researchers may wish to set a minimum threshold for positivity or negativity
#  before they declare a text definitively positive or negative â€“ for instance,
#  the official VADER documentation suggests a threshold of -0.5 and 0.5
