I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.'''

# scores prints: compound: -0.3804, neg: 0.093, neu: 0.836, pos: 0.071,

#  Researchers may wish to set a minimum threshold for positivity or negativity
#  before they declare a text definitively positive or negative â€“ for instance,
#  the official VADER documentation suggests a threshold of -0.5 and 0.5
